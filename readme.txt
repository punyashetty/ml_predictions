Data sets:* To build the model, please use model.csv file * To validate the model, please use val.csv fileGoal: Correctly predict default candidates (1 means default, 0 means non-default) using val.csv fileStep 1 - Clean and prepare your data:There are several entries where values have been deleted to simulate dirty data. Please clean the data with whatever method(s) you believe is best/most suitable. Success in this exercise typically involves feature engineering and avoiding data leakage.Step 2 - Build your models:We request to make two models: Logistic Regression and any other machine learning/statistical models to correctly predict 'default' candidates.Please include comments that document choices you make (such as those for feature engineering and for model tuning).Step 3 - Generate predictions:Create predictions on the data in val.csv using each of your trained models.  The predictions should be the class probabilities for belonging to the default class (labeled '1').Be sure to output a prediction for each of the rows in the validation dataset (val.csv).  Save the results of each of your models in a separate CSV file.  Title the two files 'results1.csv' and 'results2.csv'.  A result file should each have a single column representing the output from one model (no header label or index column is needed).
